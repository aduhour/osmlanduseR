#' Classify Land Use
#'
#' Classify OpenStreetMap tags into predefined land use classes,
#' removes overlapping polygons and measure area.
#'
#' @details
#' The function classifies every land use polygon to the selected classes,
#' removes overlapping prioritizing smaller polygons as suggested by
#' Schultz et al., (2017) (method \code{smaller}),
#' or establishing land use priorities as suggested by Fonte et al., (2016)
#' (method \code{hierarchichal}),
#' then adds a column with the area measure.
#'
#' The default coordinate reference system is EPSG:5347 (POSGAR 2007),
#' adopted by the National Geographic Institute for Argentina.

#' @param osmlanduse An sf object, part of the output of \code{get_osmlanduse}.
#' @param osm_tag A vector of OpenStreetMap tag values
#' @param class_name A vector of the same length of \code{osm_tag} assigning a
#' class name or number to each OpenStreetMap tag.
#' @param crs Set the Coordinate Reference System to transform the data to measure area.
#' @param units The units for the area measures.
#' @param priority A vector of the same length of \code{osm_tag}, assigning
#' integers from 1 (greater priority) to the number of land use classes.
#' @param method The method to resolve orverlapping polygons (see Details).
#' @return A list with an sf object with the classified land use classes and
#' area measures added, and an sf object with non polygon elements that could be
#' used to solve mapping issues.

  # pp 208: Issues of overlapping features were resolved by prioritizing smaller
  # polygons over larger ones (Fig. 3). This is essential for the calculation of
  # correct area statistics or potential comparisons to other data, and gives
  # priority to the detail in the map.
